4. In what all modes Hadoop can be run?
5. Explain the major difference between HDFS block and InputSplit.
6. What is distributed cache? What are its benefits?
7. Explain the difference between NameNode, Checkpoint NameNode, and Backup Node.
9. Define DataNode. How does NameNode tackle DataNode failures?
15. What happens if you try to run a Hadoop job with an output directory that is already present? Throw Exception
17. How to configure Replication Factor in HDFS?   hdfs-site.xml
19. What is the difference between Map-side Join and Reduce-side Join?
20. How can you transfer data from Hive to HDFS?  hive> insert overwrite directory '/' select * from emp;The output we receive will be stored in part files in the specified HDFS path.

Q. Hive internal and external tables
Q. Hive bucketing
Q. Hive partitioning
Q. Mapside join in hive
we will perform the Map-side join on these two datasets. Map-side joins can be enabled in two ways.
Mapside using hint
select /*+MAPJOIN(departments)*/ employees.ename from employees join departments ON (departments.depid = employees.dpid);
2. By setting the following property to true.
set hive.auto.convert.join.noconditionaltask = true; 
set hive.auto.convert.join.noconditionaltask.size = 10000;
Q. HIVE how will you create a UDF
   use jan26hive;
   add jar /home/training/Desktop/jan26batch/hiveudfs/hive_lowercase.jar;
   create temporary function BJAN26LOWER as 'com.example.hive.udf.Lower';
   select depname, BJAN26LOWER(depname) from departments;
   hive -f /home/training/Desktop/jan26batch/hivescripts/hive2.hql
Q. 
set hive.enforce.bucketing = true; 
Hive Buckets is nothing but another technique of decomposing data or decreasing the data into
more manageable parts or equal parts.

CREATE TABLE bucket_table(empname string, empid int, empdep string, emploc string)
COMMENT 'Example for bucketed table'
CLUSTERED BY (emploc) INTO 3 BUCKETS
row format delimited
fields terminated by ',';

load data local inpath '/home/hduser/mrinputs/empdata.txt' overwrite into table bucket_table;

Retrieving the data from bucketed table
select * from bucket_table tablesample(bucket 1 out of 3 on emploc);
using percentage
select * from bucket_table tablesample(10 percent);
